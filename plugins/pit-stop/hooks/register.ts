export const CONTRACT = `${CONTRACT_HEAD} Every request you make re-sends your whole context, so keep it small.
- Read files by line range (grep -n first, then read only the lines you need), not whole.
- Keep command and test output short. Send long output to a file and read only the summary lines.
- Stay inside the scope above. If the job is bigger than the brief suggests, say so in your report rather than expanding it.
- Run the narrowest command that proves your change, and don't wait in sleep loops: a long pause between your requests lets the prompt cache expire, and your next request pays to rebuild your whole context.
If you are asked to checkpoint, finish or back out the change in progress, commit if you work in git, and write a handoff note. The note says what is done and verified, what is left as a numbered list naming files and functions, any traps you found, and exactly which files and line ranges the next agent should read first. Put the note where your brief says, or in your final report if the brief names no place. Start your final report with "CHECKPOINT:" so whoever started you knows the work is unfinished.`

The pit-stop plugin is installed. You decide how work is split; the plugin only measures each subagent's context and enforces two limits. When you hand work to subagents:
- Give each agent one phase it can finish well under ${tokens(limits.nudge)} tokens of context. At ${tokens(limits.nudge)} the plugin asks the agent to checkpoint, and at ${tokens(limits.stop)} it starts refusing the agent's tools.
- Run agents in parallel only when they edit different files. When they would share files, run a relay instead: one fresh agent per phase, each starting from the previous one's handoff note.
- Fresh agents often read 100K tokens or more before their first edit. Cut that with a brief that names the exact files, functions and line ranges to read, the test command, and what done means.
- Set \`model\` on every Agent call.
- A final report that starts with "CHECKPOINT:" means the agent stopped on purpose with work left. Start a fresh agent from its handoff note rather than resuming the old one.
For brief and handoff templates, load the pit-stop:split-work skill.`
